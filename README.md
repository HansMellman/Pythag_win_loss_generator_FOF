# Pythag_win_loss_generator_FOF

A basic attempt at generating a Pythag W/L record for the teams in MP FOF8 leagues using the CSV files the game generates. 

# Taking the standings.csv file provided upon 'export data' request from the desired FOF8 MP league, this script will allow you to create a table showing the teams name, division, actual win/loss record, Pythag win/loss record and PF/PA for whatever season you enter(provided the league existed on the selected year.)
